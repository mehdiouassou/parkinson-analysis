# --- HARDWARE SPECIFIC ---
# Do NOT include torch/torchvision here (Installed via NVIDIA wheels)
# Do NOT include pyrealsense2 here (Compiled manually)
# Do NOT include tensorrt here (Copied from system)

# --- INFERENCE ---
# We list opencv because we installed the CPU version via pip to satisfy YOLO
opencv-python

# Ultralytics (YOLO)
# Note: We install with --no-deps to avoid pulling in 'polars' which fails to build on Jetson
# and to avoid overwriting NVIDIA's torch/torchvision wheels.
# Run: pip install ultralytics==8.4.14 --no-deps
