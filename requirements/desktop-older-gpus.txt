# --- GPU SUPPORT FOR OLDER GENERATIONS ---
# Use this requirements file if you have an older NVIDIA GPU.
# Specifically, newer PyTorch versions (2.10+) dropped support for 
# GPUs with CUDA compute capability 6.1 or lower.
#
# This file installs PyTorch 2.4.1, the last version supporting these older GPUs.
#
# Affected GPU architectures include:
#   - Pascal architecture (GTX 10-series: 1060, 1070, 1080, Titan Xp)
#   - Maxwell architecture (GTX 9-series: 970, 980, Titan X)
#   - Older Quadro and Tesla cards (e.g., P4000, M60)
#
# Usage:
#   pip install -r requirements/desktop-older-gpus.txt
